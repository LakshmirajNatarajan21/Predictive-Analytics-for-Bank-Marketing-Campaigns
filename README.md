# Predictive-Analytics-for-Bank-Marketing-Campaigns

## Overview
This repository contains the work for a predictive analytics project focused on bank marketing campaigns. The goal was to develop machine learning models to predict customer subscriptions for term deposits based on historical marketing data.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to:

Analyze and preprocess customer data.
Build and compare machine learning models to predict subscription likelihood.
Provide actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies and resource allocation.

## Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into customer behaviors, identifying key features like contact duration and account balance.
Machine Learning Models: Comparison of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for predictive accuracy.
Actionable Insights: Recommendations for targeting high-potential customers.

## Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

### 📈 Key Insights & Findings
